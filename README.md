## Description

This project ties together all new technologies learnt such as Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. 
Through this project I learnt several key concepts, such as:
* OOP principles, and creating objects using factory patterns and constructors for better code management.
* Organising application logic seperately from the DOM, and utilising helper modules.
* Utilising Webpack to bundle JS files together and handle assets.
